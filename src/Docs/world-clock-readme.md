    4. No Third Party APIs / Modules
        - World Clock relies on JavaScript's built-in 'Intl' API for retrieving country's Date and Time information.

    5. Daylight Saving Time (DST) - Safe
        - World Clock does not relies on manual computation of a country's Date and Time, instead, it relies more on JavaScript's built-in
          'Intl' API which, officially retrieves a synced Date and Time using the country's timezone id. You don't have to worry about 
          inaccurate Date and Time of a country when they get any time-leaf or what is called Daylight-Saving-Time, the system of World 
          Clock itself would handle it automatically for you.
